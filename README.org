* flymake-actionlint1
~flymake-actionlint1.el~ is a ~flymake~ backend for [[https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint][actionlint]], a static checker for GitHub Actions workflow files.

There is another package for exactly the same purpose, [[https://github.com/ROCKTAKEY/flymake-actionlint/][flymake-actionlint]], which is already available from MELPA, but I failed to get it working and thought it would be faster to rewrite an alternative from scratch, thanks to my experience in writing another flymake backend.

And this package is not going to be on MELPA.
