* flymake-actionlint1
~flymake-actionlint1.el~ is a ~flymake~ backend for [[https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint][actionlint]], a static checker for GitHub Actions workflow files.

There is another package created exactly for the same purpose,
[[https://github.com/ROCKTAKEY/flymake-actionlint/][flymake-actionlint]], which is already available from MELPA.
I somehow failed to get it working, but it was easy to write an alternative
from scratch. Problem solved.
